# Project52 Challenge

Inspired by [reflectionsfrom 52 weeks 52 projects](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects), i'm feeling free to choose anything to learn. The purpose is based in make one project every week, but I saw this quote and I felt more inspired yet: 

##### "Your work is a direct reflection of your knowledge."

That's really, really makes sense! So, this is my reflection about this quote: JUST DO SOMETHING TO LEARN! READ A FUCKING BOOK EVERY WEEK, DO SOME PROJECT EVERY WEEK AND SHUUUT UP!
